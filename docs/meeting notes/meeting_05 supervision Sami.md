# Supervision Meeting with Sami - 22/11-2023

# Questions for Sami:
- is it enough state of the art? the methods we found from other papers
- how to determine the number of PCA components? and whether to do PCA at all?
	- is our methodology valid?
- calculation of loss before or after inversing?
- what is meant by "bioinspired hierarchy"?
