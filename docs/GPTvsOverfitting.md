Your model is indeed quite complex. You have multiple blocks with several linear layers, each followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. Additionally, you have separate subject-specific models that process the data in parallel with a shared model. This complexity can lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is not large enough to warrant such a model size.

Here are a few aspects of your model that could contribute to overfitting:

1. **Depth of the Network**: Your model has multiple sequential blocks. Each block has three linear layers with a batch normalization and ReLU activation. This deep architecture can easily overfit if the number of samples is not large enough or the variation within the data is limited.

2. **Number of Parameters**: Your model seems to have a significant number of parameters due to multiple dense layers, which increases the risk of overfitting.

3. **Subject-Specific Models**: You have a separate model for each subject. If the number of samples per subject is not large enough, these subject-specific models can memorize the training data.

To mitigate overfitting, you might consider the following strategies:

- **Simplify Your Model**: Reduce the number of layers or units per layer to lower the model's capacity.
  
- **Regularization**: Add L1 or L2 regularization to the layers to penalize large weights.

- **Dropout**: You already have a dropout layer with a probability of 0.25, which is good. You might experiment with different dropout rates or add dropout to more layers to see if it helps.

- **Data Augmentation**: Since your inputs are images, you can use image augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of your training set.

- **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping to finish training when the validation loss stops improving.

- **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model performs well across different subsets of your data.

- **Reduce PCA Components**: If you're still using a large number of PCA components, try reducing the number to see if the model can generalize better with less information.

- **Batch Size**: Experiment with different batch sizes. Sometimes, smaller batch sizes can help the model generalize better.

Remember that the key is to ensure that the complexity of your model is appropriate for the size and variability of your dataset. Regularization, simplification, and validation are crucial steps in achieving a model that generalizes well.
