  ## Problem Statement
To reach our learning goals, your task as a group is to:

* understand a chosen problem, select appropriate (existing and recent) dataset(s), and understand feasible existing solutions (the *state of the art*), 
* select and implement (at least) one machine learning method - as a general rule, you may take code pieces from existing repositories/exercises/papers as long as you understand and can explain that code, and cite it, 
* evaluate and report your solution for appropriate measure w.r.t. your chosen problem (e.g. accuracy/performance, edge cases, model behaviour) - and discuss/reflect peculiar strengths and weaknesses.

As optional additional steps, we highly encourage you to (and/or):
* expand a solution with your own original ideas, 
* transfer your solution onto different datasets (potentially from different domains),
* experiment with novel approaches to add insight/explainability about the models' decisions.

For this, you can either select one of the prepared projects below or create your own.
